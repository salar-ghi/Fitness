Both the hamstrings and the quadriceps pull on the knee joint, so if one of those muscles is stronger than the other, then knee problems are bound to arise. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the hamstrings are 2/3 as strong as the quadriceps.

        "description": "The hamstrings are the big muscles on the back of your thighs. Together with the quadriceps, the hamstrings make walking and standing possible.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are made up of the following muscles - the biceps femoris (short and long head), the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are a weak muscle when compared with the quadriceps (front thigh muscle). Both the hamstrings and the quadriceps pull on the knee joint, so if one of those muscles is stronger than the other, then knee problems are bound to arise. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the hamstrings are 2/3 as strong as the quadriceps. For example, if you can resist 100 lbs with your quads, then you should be able to resist 66 lbs with your hamstrings.",

Together with the quadriceps, the hamstrings make walking and standing possible.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are made up of the following muscles - the biceps femoris (short and long head), the semimembranosus, and the semitendinosus.\r\n\r\nThe hamstrings are a weak muscle when compared with the quadriceps (front thigh muscle). Both the hamstrings and the quadriceps pull on the knee joint, so if one of those muscles is stronger than the other, then knee problems are bound to arise. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that the hamstrings are 2/3 as strong as the quadriceps. For example, if you can resist 100 lbs with your quads, then you should be able to resist 66 lbs with your hamstrings.",
